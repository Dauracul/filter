# Dauracul's PD2 Loot Filter
This is intended to be a very non-invasive loot filter. No bright neon flashy colors, just clean and informative but it still will highlight items of value. Great for players who are already familiar with loot they are seeking out and for crafters who would like upfront information on cube recipes.

# General Features
- Number of sockets shown on all bases
- Ethereal items tagged with (Eth)
- Superior tag is shorthanded in Red for Weapon bases and Blue for Armor bases, and will display the % of Enhanced Defense or Enhanced Damage
